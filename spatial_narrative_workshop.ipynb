We have selected <cdplace>Penrith</cdplace> as the starting point, because <cdplace>Ulleswater</cdplace>, one of the finest of the lakes, is seen to greatest advantage by being approached from this direction, while it is as convenient a quarter as any of the others from which to set out on a tour through the district.</p>\n","\n","<p>With the carefully prepared map attached to this guide, the tourist will experience no difficulty in tracing the main route and the diverging excursions here laid down; and a very little consideration, with the aid of occasional inquiry as to minuti&#230; when on the spot, will enable him to vary his proceedings according to inclination. He will farther be very much aided in these investigations by observing the distinct markings on the map which include bridle-paths and carriage-roads. In a tour of this description we believe that minute detail in regard to every possible route is unnecessary, and would only prove perplexing. We conceive that the\n","\n","<pb n=\"2\" />\n","\n","mere mention of <i>all</i> the places and objects of interest, with <i>one</i> good route to the most of them, and a slight indication of others, is all that is required. This we have attempted to give in these pages, and we trust that the traveller will find the volume sufficiently explicit, while the beautiful engravings with which it is embellished will enable him in some degree to anticipate the scenery he is about to visit.\n","\n","<gap desc=\"symbol\" />\n","\n","THERE is, perhaps, no part of <cdplace>Great Britain</cdplace> more beautiful and picturesque, more varied in its scenery, or more calculated to afford intense gratification to the tourist, - whether he travels as a man of science, as a painter, or simply as an admirer of the works of his Creator, - than the <cdplace>Lake District</cdplace> of <cdplace>England</cdplace>. It is rich in flowers, rare plants, and luxuriant undergrowth. Its numerous mountains present a tempting field of investigation to the geologist. Its ruins and several very curious Roman and Druidical remains furnish points of interest to the antiquarian, while its woods and streams are associated with the names of many of our greatest poets. Its scenery presents every variety of landscape, from the weather-beaten mountain crags and peaks, the brawling rivulets, and the wild ravines of the highlands, to the outspread lakes, the cottages, and level cultivated plains of the valleys - and in the picturesque effects of light and shade, caused by the changeful nature of its skies, the varied and happy combination of its parts, and the richness of its colouring, it is pre-eminently beautiful. Contained within an area of not more than fifty miles in diameter, the lakes, and all the points of interest in their vicinity, may be visited in a short space of time; and owing to the comparatively small scale of the scenery, the mind of the traveller is kept constantly on the <i>qui vive</i> by the multitude of ever-varying and lovely objects presented in his view. Amid the wild and magnificent scenery of the <cdplace>Scotch Highlands</cdplace>, and, much\n","\n","<pb n=\"3\" />\n","\n","more, among the mountains and vales of <cdplace>Switzerland</cdplace> and <cdplace>Norway</cdplace>, the traveller, - albeit fulfilled with admiration at the majestic objects of nature around him, - is so completely lost in the immensity of space, and, in consequence of the magnitude of things, is frequently so long confined to one slowly shifting scene, that he entirely loses those softer feelings of placid delight which are aroused by the contemplation of equally wild and picturesque scenery on a reduced scale. The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of <cdplace>Cumberland</cdplace>, <cdplace>Westmoreland</cdplace>, and <cdplace>Lancashire</cdplace>, although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom. There are many routes by which the traveller may visit the lakes. That which we have selected as the groundwork of the present volume is one of the most central, and one by which all the principal lakes may be visited. It is also the best, perhaps, that can be followed by pedestrians.</p>\n","\n","<p>At all seasons the scenery of the lake district is beautiful, and will amply reward the traveller who visits it; but the best time to do so is in August and September, particularly the latter month and in October, as the autumnal foliage at this time clothes the whole country in the most gorgeous hues, while the weather is usually steady and fine.

We have selected  Penrith  as the starting point, because  Ulleswater , one of the finest of the lakes, is seen to greatest advantage by being approached from this direction, while it is as convenient a quarter as any of the others from which to set out on a tour through the district. \\n\\n With the carefully prepared map attached to this guide, the tourist will experience no difficulty in tracing the main route and the diverging excursions here laid down; and a very little consideration, with the aid of occasional inquiry as to minutiæ when on the spot, will enable him to vary his proceedings according to inclination. He will farther be very much aided in these investigations by observing the distinct markings on the map which include bridle-paths and carriage-roads. In a tour of this description we believe that minute detail in regard to every possible route is unnecessary, and would only prove perplexing. We conceive that the\\n\\n \\n\\nmere mention of  all  the places and objects of interest, with  one  good route to the most of them, and a slight indication of others, is all that is required. This we have attempted to give in these pages, and we trust that the traveller will find the volume sufficiently explicit, while the beautiful engravings with which it is embellished will enable him in some degree to anticipate the scenery he is about to visit.\\n\\n \\n\\nTHERE is, perhaps, no part of  Great Britain  more beautiful and picturesque, more varied in its scenery, or more calculated to afford intense gratification to the tourist, - whether he travels as a man of science, as a painter, or simply as an admirer of the works of his Creator, - than the  Lake District  of  England . It is rich in flowers, rare plants, and luxuriant undergrowth. Its numerous mountains present a tempting field of investigation to the geologist. Its ruins and several very curious Roman and Druidical remains furnish points of interest to the antiquarian, while its woods and streams are associated with the names of many of our greatest poets. Its scenery presents every variety of landscape, from the weather-beaten mountain crags and peaks, the brawling rivulets, and the wild ravines of the highlands, to the outspread lakes, the cottages, and level cultivated plains of the valleys - and in the picturesque effects of light and shade, caused by the changeful nature of its skies, the varied and happy combination of its parts, and the richness of its colouring, it is pre-eminently beautiful. Contained within an area of not more than fifty miles in diameter, the lakes, and all the points of interest in their vicinity, may be visited in a short space of time; and owing to the comparatively small scale of the scenery, the mind of the traveller is kept constantly on the  qui vive  by the multitude of ever-varying and lovely objects presented in his view. Amid the wild and magnificent scenery of the  Scotch Highlands , and, much\\n\\n \\n\\nmore, among the mountains and vales of  Switzerland  and  Norway , the traveller, - albeit fulfilled with admiration at the majestic objects of nature around him, - is so completely lost in the immensity of space, and, in consequence of the magnitude of things, is frequently so long confined to one slowly shifting scene, that he entirely loses those softer feelings of placid delight which are aroused by the contemplation of equally wild and picturesque scenery on a reduced scale. The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of  Cumberland ,  Westmoreland , and  Lancashire , although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom. There are many routes by which the traveller may visit the lakes. That which we have selected as the groundwork of the present volume is one of the most central, and one by which all the principal lakes may be visited. It is also the best, perhaps, that can be followed by pedestrians. \\n\\n At all seasons the scenery of the lake district is beautiful, and will amply reward the traveller who visits it; but the best time to do so is in August and September, particularly the latter month and in October, as the autumnal foliage at this time clothes the whole country in the most gorgeous hues, while the weather is usually steady and fine. Our starting point shall be \\n\\n PENRITH . \\n INNS - GEORGE AND CROWN.  \\n\\n This is a clean-looking ancient town in the south of the county of  Cumberland , lying near the junction of the  Eamont  and  Lowther , and containing upwards of 6000 inhabitants. There are many objects of interest in and around the town, the chief of which are, the ruins of the castle - the church-yard, in which is a curious ancient monument called the\\n\\n \\n\\n Giant\\'s Grave ;- the  Beacon , from the top of which the view of some of the distant lakes is very fine and extensive;- the  Giant\\'s Caves , and a group of curious stones called  Long Meg and her Daughters . At Old  Penrith  are the remains of a Roman station, and the seats of the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood are numerous. \\n\\n From  Penrith  two roads lead to  Pooley Bridge , about six miles distant, which spans the  Eamont  just at its issue from  Ulleswater . Either road may be taken, be we recommend that which follows the  Shap road  to  Eamont Bridge .  Carleton Hall  is near to it on the left. Cross the bridge, and take the first road to the right. At this point, on the left, are the druidical remains called  King Arthur\\'s Round Table , and  Mayborough . Immediately after crossing  Pooley Bridge , the road runs along the western shore of \\n\\n ULLESWATER \\n\\n To  Patterdale , a distance of ten miles; but, before proceeding along it, the tourist would do well to take a walk of a few miles along the eastern shore, in the direction of  Martindale , from several points on which he will obtain a good view of the lake. Should this deviation be made, it will be necessary to return by the same road to  Pooley Bridge , where there are two small inns, at which boats, for an excursion on the water, or for fishing, may be procured if desired. A fine view may be had from the top of  Dunmallet , on which are the vestiges of a Roman fort. There is some good fishing here in the lake and stream. Trout, perch, and eels, are numerous, and large lake-trout are sometimes, though seldom, taken.  Lowther Castle , the seat of the  Earl of Lonsdale , is distant from this bridge about four miles.  Ulleswater  is nine miles in length, by nearly a mile wide, at the broadest point; but, owing to its irregular form, it is divided into three reaches, the first of which is closed in by  Hallen Fell , on the western shore. The second is ter-\\n\\n \\n\\nminated by  Stybarrow Crag  on the east, with  Helvellyn  towering in the distance behind it, and  Birk Fell  on the west. The third reach is decidedly the most beautiful, being surrounded by towering mountains, and studded with little islands, which, combined with the woods and rich vegetation, present a magnificent scene. The view in our engraving is taken from  Birk Fell , having  Stybarrow Crag  on the right. After leaving  Pooley Bridge , the scenery, for the first three or four miles, is comparatively tame; but after passing the village of  Watermillock , it improves rapidly. About a mile beyond  Halsteads , the road enters  Gowbarrow Park , formerly the hunting seat of the  Duke of Norfolk , now the property of Mr. Howards of  Greystoke . It is of great size, and is filled with beautiful groups of trees, among which may be seen herds of fallow-deer, whose presence give the additional charm of wilderness to the scene.  Lyulph\\'s Tower , which stands on an eminence here, is a picturesque object; and there are many exquisite \"bits\" of minute scenery, clad with luxuriant verdure, that will delight the eye of a painter. From  Lyulph\\'s Tower , a delightful walk runs up a rocky vale to a waterfall called \\n\\n AIRA FORCE . \\n\\n\\n Force is the general name for a waterfall. \\n\\n This is a beautiful fall. It leaps from the top of a wooded cliff, through a narrow gorge, and descends a sheer perpendicular height of eighty feet. The roar of the falling waters, and the descending of spray, add to the feelings of romance created by the view of rugged rocks, thickly planted trees, and hanging verdure, which characterize the spot. At the upper end of the park the last reach of the lake opens up the view, in a majestic sweep round the mountains on the opposite side. The shores are bold, covered partly with wood, and indented with bays. The road now passes under  Stybarrow Crag, \\n\\n \\n\\nwhich raises its broken and scarred front on the right, while a steep bank descends into the deep waters of the lake on the left, and, winding round the head of  Ulleswater , it conducts to the village of \\n\\n PATTERDALE , \\n\\n Where there is a good inn, at which boats and guides may be procured. Some time ought to be spent here in visiting the beautiful scenes in the vicinity. Among these are,- the little  islands  at the head of the lake, in visiting which a day might be pleasantly whiled away. Some of the best views on the shores of  Ulleswater  are to be had from the lake itself, by rowing past the islands called  Cherry Holme  and  House Holme , and approaching towards  Stybarrow Crag .  Helvellyn  stand between four and five miles from the village. By ascending it, the visitor will be amply repaid for his toil by a magnificent, map-like view of the lake district. The mountain is 3055 feet above the sea-level, but is easy of ascent, and ponies can be taken to the top. There are two ways of approach from  Patterdale ; the best is by  Glenridding . This valley is traversed by a stream, which ought to be followed to its source in the  Red Tarn , lying a few hundred feet below the top of the mountain. The south-east boundary of the Tarn is a ridge of rock called  Striding Edge , and the north-west is another ridge called  Swirrel Edge . The latter must be followed, as striding edge is exceedingly dangerous. There is a spring, called  Brownrigg\\'s Well , not more than 300 yards from the summit of the mountain, on the south-west side. For a short ramble, the Place Fell Quarry, half a mile from the inn, may be visited, as it affords a good view of  Ulleswater : and the valley of  Martindale  exhibits some beautiful scenery. There is a mountain called  High Street , little more than four miles distant from the inn; but he who ascends  Helvellyn  need not waste time in scaling this mountain, which is 2700 feet height, and de-\\n\\n \\n\\nrives its name from a road which the Romans constructed over it. From  Patterdale , also, a detour may be made on foot across the  Martindale Fells  to \\n\\n HAWES WATER , \\n\\n Which lies between five and six miles east of the village. This sheet of water is usually visited from  Kendal  or  Penrith , by way of  Shap ; but by the way we recommend, the distance is shortened very much, and the direct route to the principal lakes not interrupted.  Hawes Water  is three miles long, and about half a mile broad; it is embosomed in high mountains, and its eastern shores are clothed by the wood of  Naddle Forest . The village of  Bampton  lies about two miles from the foot of the lake.  High Street  and  Kidsty Pike  rear their summits above the head of it. Here there is a little village, or hamlet, called  Mardale Green , where is a small inn. There is good fishing in  Hawes Water  and  Angle Tarn , both being within a short distance of  Patterdale . Returning to  Patterdale  make an excursion to \\n\\n BROTHERS WATER , \\n\\n Or, if time cannot be afforded to do so, the lake may be seen while travelling to  Ambleside  (which is ten miles from  Patterdale ), and especially from  Kirkstone Pass , over which the road runs to  Ambleside . The view here is exceedingly fine, and when lighted up by the slanting rays of the sun, and glowing in the garb and glory of an autumnal evening, it must be quite magnificent. From this point, however, the view of  Brothers Water  is somewhat distant. The lake is a large tarn, deriving its name from the circumstance of two brothers having been drowned there. Before leaving this scene, much enjoyment may be derived from a visit to the beautiful valley of  Deepdale , which runs up into the mountains from  Bridge End , two miles from  Patterdale .\\n\\n \\n\\nJust beyond this bridge is a splendid view of the surrounding country.  Dodd , with its sloping sides,  Kidsty Pike ,  Grey Crag , part of  Placefell  and  Colddale Crags  are on the east of the road; and to the west are  Dodd Bield , the  Screes ,  Low-wood  on the borders of  Bothers Water , &c.  Hartsope  should also be visited for beautiful scenery.  Kirkstone Pass  derives its name from a large stone at the head of the pass, which bears a fancied resemblance to a church. There is a small inn here; and at this point the road to  Troutbeck  turns to the left.  Windermere  is seen on descending the pass, and three miles beyond lies the village of \\n\\n AMBLESIDE . \\n\\n INNS - COMMERCIAL, SALUTATION, WHITE LION. \\n\\n This village ought to be made head-quarters, being a convenient central point, from which excursions may be made in all directions.  Ambleside  is a small market town, irregularly built, in the  valley of Rothay , about a mile from the head of  Windermere . It was once a Roman station, and several fragments of old pavement and other Roman relics have been dug up in the neighbourhood. Traces of a fortress have also been discovered. The town stands on a steep incline at the base of  Wansfell , and, excepting towards the south-west, is enclosed by mountains on all sides. It is a favourite resort of tourists. A few hundred yards behind the  Salutation Inn  is the  Stock Gill River , where is a fine fall called the \\n\\n STOCK GILL FORCE , \\n\\n Which is seventy feet in height, consisting of four separate leaps. Owing to the superabundance of wood, and undergrowth, it is not easy to obtain a good view of this fall. Visitors usually view it from the top of the bank, which is the worst position in which any fall can be seen. By a little\\n\\n \\n\\nscrambling, however, the view presented in our engraving may be obtained. This fall being easy of access, will naturally engage the visitors attention first. Afterwards he will visit \\n\\n WINDERMERE . \\n\\n\\n This is the largest of all the English lakes, but the character of the scenery is not so grand as that of the others. The visitor is, therefore, in danger of being disappointed if he be not prepared for a much softer - but to some minds not less pleasing - style of scenery than that through which he has already passed. The landscape generally is characterized more by grace and richness than by grandeur. Measured by the road, Windermere is upwards of thirteen miles long - in a straight line it is not much more than ten miles - and about a mile broad at its widest part. There are two principal feeders to this lake, - the rivers  Rothay  and  Brathay . The first, rising in the mountains near  Wythburn , passes through the lakes of  Grasmere  and  Rydal  before entering  Windermere . The second rises in a mountain range called  Langdale Pikes , and unites with the  Rothay  near  Croft Lodge , a short distance from the lake. There is a very curious and interesting circumstance connected with the fish of these rivers. As the spawning season approaches, the  trout  and  charr  ascend the stream together until they arrive at the point where the waters unite. Here they always separate;  all  the trout proceeding up the  Rothay , while  all the charr go up the  Brathay . It is difficult to conjecture the cause of this separation, but the perfectness of the understanding on both sides, and the unvarying regularity of the arrangement, would incline us to suppose that their Creator had endowed these fish with an instinct little, if at all, short of reason. Among other tributary streams is the  Troutbeck , which falls into the lake near  Calgarth . Its waters are discharged at  Newby Bridge  where they receive the name of the  river Leven , which,\\n\\n \\n\\ntwo miles farther on, falls into the estuary called the  Leven Sands . At  Bowness  there is a ferry over the lake, from which a fine view of the mountains and scenery at its head is obtained.  Windermere  is very deep, varying from thirty to a hundred and twenty feet; and it is remarkably clear, permitting the eye to penetrate far into its depths, where the finny inhabitants gambol in shoals. Owing to its great depth heavy rains do not make any perceptible increase in its volume. At  Waterhead , scarcely a mile distant, boats may be procured for excursions on the lake. These excursions, of course, will be made to various parts according to the taste of the visitors. One good route to take is along the  Brathay  coast, and across the lake to  Low-wood Inn . The island of  Belle Isle , near  Bowness , is a point of interest. It is upwards of a mile in circumference, and belongs to  H. Curwen Esq. , who has a summer residence on it. Strangers are allowed to land and walk among the groves and woods with which abounds, and, as plants and underwood are luxuriant, it presents a rich field of research to the botanist. From its upper end the prospect is very fine, embracing the head of the lake with its bays and wooded promontories; its islands and its back ground of mountains, - the  Kentmore range ,  High Street ,  Wansfield Pike ,  Hill-Bell ,  Fairfield  and  Rydal Nab . The islands in view are  Hen Holm , and  Lady Holm ,. There is a point just behind the  Ferry Inn  which ought to be visited, as a fine view of the surrounding scenery may be obtained from it. \\n\\n In this neighbourhood are many interesting walks; among others there is a foot-path to the top of  Bisket How , and a walk through the  Parsonage Land  to the  Ferry Point .  Storrs Hall  is finely situated, and worthy of a visit. Excursions to the various islets of the lake will also be found interesting, an, for those who wish to take a rapid survey of its entire length, there are steamers which make daily trips from one end of the lake to the other. The road from  Bowness  to the head of  Windermere  is picturesque, and\\n\\n \\n\\nbeing little more than four miles in length, might, for the sake of variety, be taken by those who make the downward journey by water.  Low-wood inn  is passed on the way; it affords a fine view of the lake. The lower part of  Windermere  is not often visited, but there are many interesting points of view there, and the  Coniston  mountains are seen rising in the distance above the western shores. Should the visitor have sufficient time he would find a drive round the entire lake (about thirty miles) an agreeable and interesting excursion. \\n\\n At the ferry near  Bowness , about the year 1635, a marriage party was crossing in a boat, when one of those squalls, to which  Windermere  is rather liable, upset the boat, and all its occupants, about fifty in number, including the bride and bridegroom, were drowned. \\n\\n A branch from the  Lancaster and Carlisle railway  conducts from  Kendal  to  Birthwaite , a mile to the north of  Bowness , and near the shores of the lake. From the station here coaches run to  Ambleside  and  Keswick ,  Hawkshead  and  Coniston ; and the mail goes daily to  Cockermouth , from which there is a railway to  Whitehaven . The numerous elegant villas, and picturesque cottages, which nestle amid the luxuriant woodlands, and cover the verdant slopes and shores of  Windermere , add greatly to the richness of the landscape. Besides the stations already mentioned,  Ferry Inn , on the promontory over against  Bowness , and  Newby Bridge  at the foot of the lake, afford good accommodation, guides and boats, to the tourist. \\n\\n In the route we have laid down,  Coniston Water  and  Esthwaite Lake  are omitted, neither of them being equal to the other scenery of the lake district; but, for the benefit of the tourist who has much time on his hands, we subjoin a brief outline of these lakes and their environs. \\n\\n Hawkshead , \\n\\n A small town with an inn (the Red Lion), is scarcely five\\n\\n \\n\\nmiles from  Ambleside . There is nothing of particular interest about it except that  Wordsworth  the poet and his brother were educated at the school there. Close to this town lies the lake of \\n\\n Esthwaite , \\n\\n About two miles long, and scarcely half a mile broad. The scenery around this lake is tame, but pleasing, and a curious floating island, of about thirty or forty yards in circumference, lies on a pond near the head of the lake; during windy weather, this island, with the trees and bushes which cover it, is observed to move about. After leaving  Hawkshead  the road passes an old farm house, formerly the residence of some of the monks of  Furness Abbey . From the height here there is a fine view of the mountains around  Ambleside . Beyond this the road becomes bare and uninteresting, until the valley of  Coniston  is reached. The view of the vale with its varied scenery, amid which rises the  Old Man  Mountain, is rich, and particularly gratifying to the eye after the bleak road-scenery from which it has just emerged. Shortly after,  Waterhead Inn  is reached. It is six miles from  Ambleside , and forms a convenient resting point from which to make excursions in the neighbourhood. \\n\\n Coniston Water, , \\n\\n Or  Thurston Lake , is six miles in length, and nearly a mile in breadth. The village of  Coniston  is pleasantly situated under a hill on the west side of the water.  Coniston hall , an ancient building, is also on this side of the lake, and cottages are thinly scattered over the heights that encircle its head. A pleasant road runs through the margin, sometimes passing through groves and coppices, at other times crossing over open ground and commanding a fine prospect. At the north-west angle of the lake, near its outlet, rises the  Old Man  Mountain, the ascent of which should be made, as it commands an extensive prospect towards the south and west,\\n\\n \\n\\nwhile in other directions it is surrounded by the frowning heights of the neighbouring mountains. The  Old Man  is the highest peak of the  Coniston Fell  range, and is about 2580 feet high. In very clear weather, the  Isle of Man  may be seen from its summit. It consists chiefly of slate, which being admirably adapted for roofing, is excavated in large quantities. Besides this there are extensive copper mines situated about half way up the hill, into which they penetrate horizontally for half a mile, while the shafts are upwards of two hundred yards deep. Great numbers of people are employed in the working of those mines which belong to  Lady Le Fleming  of  Rydal Hall , who is also proprietor of the slate quarries. At a village called  Low Nibthwaite , near  Lowick Bridge , where the lake terminates in the  Crake  rivulet, there is an iron forge. The feeders of  Coniston Water  are,  Black Beck  and  Coniston Beck , and the charr in the lake are said to be the finest in  England . In ascending the  Old Man , start from the village at its base and follow the road leading to the copper mines. At the distance of half a mile from the village is a foot-bridge over the stream, which must be crossed; after this the traveller may be left to find his way to the top. Instead of returning to  Ambleside  by the same road, through  Hawkshead , the pedestrian may take the road leading from  Waterhead Inn  through  Yewdale , which, at little more than three miles distant, joins the  Little Langdale  road at a point about three miles from  Ambleside . Walks and excursions around  Ambleside  are innumerable and full of interest. We can only enumerate a few of them. \\n\\n The  Great and Little Langdales , \\n\\n Of which  Great Langdale  is the finer. If the tourist desires to visit both Langdales let him go by  Clappersgate , along the banks of the  Brathay . About three miles from  Ambleside  there is a fall of about twenty feet in height, which is embosomed in remarkably fine scenery. It is a little above\\n\\n \\n\\n Skelwith Bridge . About a mile further on, the road re-crosses the stream at  Colwith Bridge , above which there is another fell named  Colwith Force , about seventy feet in height. It is in a dell close to the road. A short distance farther on is  Little Langdale Tarn , after which the road diverging to the right ascends into a solitary scene, in the midst of which is  Blea Tarn , and thence descends into  Great Langdale . At a farm house called  Mill Beck  refreshment can be obtained.  Langdale pikes  may be ascended, and  Dungeon Gill Force  visited. Over this fall there is a natural bridge of which  Wordsworth  writes: \\n\\n \\n \"There is a spot which you may see, \\n If ever you to  Langdale  go; \\n Into a chasm a mighty block \\n Hath fall\\'n, and made a bridge of rock. \\n The gulf is deep below, \\n And in a basin black and small \\n Receives a lofty waterfall.\" \\n \\n\\n There are two roads through  Great Langdale  by which to return. The one near the hills on the left is to be preferred by pedestrians; the other is more suitable for carriages, and both pass through lovely scenery. They separate at the chapel a mile and a half from  Mill Beck . The first conducts by  Grasmere  and  Rydalmere  to the  Keswick  road; the other, passing  Elter Water ,  Loughrigg Fell  and Tarn, joins the  Clappersgate  road. The whole walk, by either way, from  Ambleside  to  Dungeon Gill Force  and back, is not more than seventeen or eighteen miles. \\n\\n Loughrigg Fell \\n\\n Should be ascended. It is not much above 1100 feet in height, and commands a fine view of all the lakes and mountains in its immediate vicinity. It is little more than a mile from the village. \\n\\n \\n\\n The vale of \\n\\n Troutbeck \\n\\n is another charming scene. Go from  Ambleside  to near  Kirkstone Pass , then turn to the right and walk down the vale along the banks of the  Troutbeck  to  Low-wood , and back along  Windermere  to  Ambleside ; being a circuit of about ten miles through very agreeable scenery. One of the finest views that can be had of  Windermere  is from this road. There are also several interesting walks around  Bowness , which is about eight miles from  Kendal ; but to particularize them would be impossible within our limits, and perhaps unnecessary, as the tourist will find it more convenient to obtain  minute local  information on the spot, as occasion may require. \\n\\n RYDAL WATER , \\n\\n And  Grasmere , now claim our attention. The highway to  Rydal  village is not more than a mile and a quarter from  Ambleside ; but for pedestrians, we recommend the footpath along the banks of the  Rothay , under  Loughrigg Fell , as being much more sylvan and agreeable. By this route the traveller proceeds along the road to  Clappersgate , until he reaches  Rothay Bridge ; crosses this, enters the first gate on the right, and proceeds thence along the river to  Pelter Bridge . About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind  Coat How  farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of  Grasmere . It is from this point that our drawing of that lake is taken. A little farther on, the road joins the  Grasmere  road, which conducts to the village of that name. By the route first mentioned, the northern shore of the lake is kept, and the pretty village of  Rydal  is passed. Here, on\\n\\n \\n\\nthe right, is  Rydal Hall , where are two picturesque falls, that ought to be seen. It is necessary to make application at the cottage near the chapel, in order to accomplish this. The lower fall is the finer of the two, and may be seen from a summerhouse in the grounds. There are some splendid trees in the park, well worth seeing. The main road beyond does not afford good views of this the smallest, but one of the most beautiful, of the English lakes. One of the few good points is  Thrang Crag , through which the road is cut, a few hundred yards beyond  Rydal  village, on the  Keswick  side. On this lake, also, is  Rydal Mount , long the dwelling-place of  Wordsworth . It stands on the hill called  Knab Scar . From this point there are some fine views. But we cannot too strongly recommend the bridle-path, on the southern shore, to those who are anxious to see the lake, with its two little grass islets, to advantage. From  Rydal Mount , a footpath passes under  Knab Scar , and rejoins the main road at  White Moss Quarry . From this walk many charming views may be had of the scenery around  Rydal Lake , which is eminently beautiful. Near  White Moss Quarry , there are two old roads to \\n\\n GRASMERE , \\n (INNS - THE RED LION, AND THE SWAN,) \\n\\n The lower one is the best, and ought to be taken in preference to the other, or to the main road, as the views from it are finer. It conducts past the celebrated  \"Wishing Gate,\"  and joins the new road, near  Wordsworth\\'s  old house, at  Town-end . This lake is larger than  Rydalmere , and the vale is remarkably beautiful. The little hill called  Butterlip How  affords a fine view, and  Red Bank  should be visited.  Grasmere  is, moreover, peculiarly interesting, as having been the residence for many years of  Wordsworth , whose magic verse has sung of almost every nook, knoll, and rivulet around it. To this vale he brought his young bride in 1802. Here\\n\\n \\n\\nmany of his brightest and happiest days were spent, - and his dust reposes in the village church of  Grasmere . Our view is taken from the road passing round  Loughrigg Fell . It shows the village in the centre, with  Steel Fell  and  Saddleback  immediately behind it.  Helm Crag  is on the left, and part of  Helvellyn  on the right.  Helm Crag  may be ascended, for the sake of the commanding view. It is about two miles from the inn to the top, and it has a curious formation of broken rocks on its summit, which has been compared by  Wordsworth  to an old woman seated on the crag. The view from this crag embraces the whole of the vale of  Grasmere ,  Helvellyn ,  Dunmail Raise ,  Wansfell Pike ,  Saddleback ,  Langdale Pikes ,  Windermere ,  Esthwaite Water , and the  Coniston range . We would recommend the tourist to take up his abode at  Grasmere  village, for  short time, as it is a convenient station for visiting the objects of beauty and interest which cluster round it. \\n\\n The secluded little valley of \\n\\n Easdale, \\n\\n Lying between  Helm Crag  and  Silver How , is extremely picturesque. Being elevated above  Grasmere , the ascent affords many fine prospects of the valley. About a mile and a half up the vale is a small cascade, called  Sour Milk Gill , on a stream which issues from a large tarn, less than half a mile further up. Beyond this there is another tarn, named  Coddale ; and further on, to the left, is a third, called  Stickle Tarn , where trout fishing is good. It lies at the foot of  Langdale Pikes , about three miles from  Grasmere . Those who are fond of climbing can ascend  the Pikes  from this valley, or cross the  Coddale Fell , into  Borrowdale . One of the summits of  Langdale Pikes  is 2400 feet high, and is named  Harrison Stickle ; the other, 2300 feet, is called  Pike o\\' Stickle . From either of these tops the view is very fine, embracing, of course, all that has been already seen from\\n\\n \\n\\nthe summit of  Helm Crag . The highest peak has the most extensive range, including part of the distant sea.  The Pikes  are usually ascended from  Langdale ; but, if the present route be adopted, it will be found more convenient and agreeable every way to ascend them from  Easdale . \\n\\n Having explored  Grasmere , the traveller should now proceed to  Keswick . Soon after quitting the village, the  Swan Inn  is passed. Should the tourist have omitted to ascend  Helvellyn  from  Patterdale , he may do so very conveniently from this point, from which the mountain is about four miles distant. The road then rises gradually until the pass of  Dunmail Raise  is reached, from which a fine retrospective view is to be had. There is a tradition connected with this pass, - that  Dunmail ,  King of Cumberland , was defeated here in 945 by the Saxon  King Edmund , who put out the eyes of  Dunmail\\'s  two sons, and gave his lands to  Malcolm King  of  Scotland . There is a cairn in memory of the victory. In reference to this,  Wordsworth  writes as follows:- \\n\\n \\n \"They now have reach\\'d that pile of stones, \\n Heap\\'d over brave  King Dunmail\\'s  bones: \\n He who once held supreme command, \\n Last king of rocky  Cumberland : \\n His bones, and those of all his power, \\n Slain here in a disastrous hour.\" \\n \\n\\n Steel Fell  lies to the west and  Seat Sandal  to the east. A little more than a mile farther, at the foot of  Helvellyn , are  Nag\\'s Head  and  Wythburn . At the inn near the chapel here inquiry ought to be made as to the proper point from which to quit the main road, in order to follow the western shores of \\n\\n \\n\\n THIRLMERE , \\n\\n As neither this lake nor its surrounding scenery can be seen to advantage from the direct road to  Keswick . A fine view of the vale of  Legberthwaite  is obtained by this route. Our drawing gives the lake, with  Saddleback  immediately behind it, -  Eagle Crag  on the left, and  Helvellyn filling up the right of the picture. The main road is rejoined at  Southwaite Moss , about four miles from  Keswick ; but, if the tourist be a pedestrian, he will find a much more agreeable route, by proceeding from this point down the beautiful vale of  St. John\\'s , by which deviation the road will be lengthened by little more than a mile. About a mile from  Keswick , on the main road, there is an eminence called  Castlerigg , from the top of which can be enjoyed one of the finest scenes in the district. \\n\\n From  Grasmere  to  Keswick  is little more than twelve miles by the direct road; but for those who disdain distance and fatigue, we cannot too strongly recommend a deviation from the highway into the mountain tracks. Start from  Grasmere , pass the western side of  Helm Crag , and go up the valley of  Easdale ; a somewhat laborious climb conducts to a level track called  Coddale Fell ; cross this, and descend by  Stonethwaite  and  Borrowdale , and so on to  Keswick . This route is about twenty miles long, but the difference in distance is more than compensated for by the exhilarating air of the hill-sides, and the commanding views of the surrounding country. \\n\\n KESWICK . \\n HOTELS - ROYAL OAK AND QUEEN\\'S HEAD. \\n\\n The tourist ought to make this town his head-quarters for some time, in order to explore and enjoy thoroughly the beauties of the surrounding district. Besides the hotels noted above, there are several excellent inns, where boats,\\n\\n \\n\\nguides, and all requisites for the comfort and convenience of the traveller are to be had. Should he determine upon spending some time in the vicinity, good board and lodging may be obtained at reasonable terms.  Keswick  is a little market-town, consisting of one large street, situate in a fine fertile valley on the south bank of the  Greta , at the foot of  Skiddaw , and half a mile from  Derwent Water .  Bassenthwaite Mere  is also in the vicinity; it is connected by a river with the former lake; and the whole of the charming landscape is studded with villages and detached cottages, embosomed among the richest verdure. There are about 2000 inhabitants in the town, who are chiefly engaged in the manufacture of the linsey-woolsey stuffs and black lead pencils, the lead for which is procured in the mines of  Borrowdale . The chief points of interest in and near the town are, the town-hall, erected in 1813; the parish church, upwards of half a mile distant, in which lie the remains of  Dr. Southey ; and the new church, an elegant building, standing on an eminence at the south end of the town, which commands a fine view of the surrounding country. There are two museums, kept by  Messrs. Crosthwaite and Hutton , which ought to be visited, as they contain many curiosities and interesting specimens of the products of the neighbourhood. There is a remarkably fine model of the lake district, exhibited by its ingenious constructor, which deserves a visit, as it is wonderfully minute and correct, and coloured according to nature. It is on the scale of three inches to the mile. There is an old bell here, which has the letters H. D. R. O. 1001, stamped on it.  Great Hall , the residence of the late  Dr. Southey , stands on an eminence not far from the town. The whole neighbourhood of  Keswick  is extremely beautiful, and rich in tempting rambles. \\n\\n \\n\\n DERWENTWATER , \\n\\n Sometimes called  Keswick Lake , is certainly one of the finest in the whole district. It is about three miles long by upwards of a mile broad, and lies within an amphitheatre of rocky, broken, picturesque mountains and precipices, whose peaks, lights, shadows, and wooded eminences are reflected from waters of peculiar clearness and considerable depth. Its surface is adorned by several islands, which are thickly wooded, and add greatly to the beauty of the scene. The chief of these are,  Lord\\'s Island , near the shore under  Wallow Crag , which formerly belonged to the family of the  Ratcliffes ,  Earls of Derwentwater ;  Vicar\\'s Island , near the foot of the lake, which belongs to  Captain Henry , whose residence stands on it;  St. Herbert\\'s Isle , in the centre, so called from a hermit who had his cell on it, and lived there in the seventh century; and  Ramp\\'s Holm . There is also here a singular floating island, which rises to the surface at intervals, and then sinks again. It varies in size, is covered with vegetation, and appeared last in 1842. It is supposed that its rise to the surface is caused by accumulation of gas formed by the decomposition of vegetable matter. The circuit of  Keswick lake  is a delightful excursion, affording many fine prospects of surpassing grandeur, wildness, and magnificence. The best views of it are to be had from  Crow Park ,  Friar\\'s Crag , and the  Vicarage . The whole vale extends almost in a straight line from the head of  Derwentwater  to the foot of  Bassenthwaite Lake , and is connected with  Borrowdale  on the south, and  Thirlmere  on the east, while on the west is  Newlands Vale .  Castlehill , one mile from  Keswick  on the  Ambleside  road, and  Ashness , afford good bird\\'s-eye views, while more distant views may be had from  Latrigg ,  Ormathwaite ,  Applethwaite , and  Braithwaite .  Skiddaw\\'s Cub  is worth ascending. \\n\\n In making the circuit of the lake, start by Borrowdale\\n\\n \\n\\nroad, passing on the left  Castle Head ,  Wallow Crag , and  Falcon Crag . There is a cleft in  Wallow Crag  called the  Lady\\'s Rake , from the circumstance of the  Countess of Derwentwater  having escaped up this gorge when her husband was arrested for high treason. About two miles from  Keswick  is  Barrow House , embosomed in very fine trees. There is a pretty cascade, upwards of 100 feet high, in the grounds, which is shown to the strangers on application at the lodge. A mile beyond this is the celebrated fall of \\n\\n LODORE , \\n\\n hich, though comparatively a small cascade, is surrounded by grand and impressive scenery. The stream falls through a chasm between the two immense upright rocks of  Gowdar Crag  on the left, and  Shepherd\\'s Crag  on the right. Its height is about 150 feet, and its rocky sides are covered with clinging trees and pendant herbage.  Southey  notices this fall in an amusing piece, which, as it were, lays bare the inexhaustible fountain whence the poet\\'s numbers flowed. Our space will not admit of more than the following extract:- \\n\\n \\n \"How does the water come down at  Lodore ? \\n Here it come sparkling, \\n And there it lies darkling; \\n Here smoking and frothing, \\n Its tumult and wrath in. \\n It hastens along, conflictingly strong, \\n Now striking and raging, as if a war waging, \\n In caverns and rocks among. \\n  *    *    *    *    * \\n And gleaming and streaming, and steaming and beaming, \\n And rushing and flushing, and gushing and brushing, \\n And flapping and sapping, and clapping and slapping, \\n And curling and whirling, and purling and twirling, \\n Retreating and meeting, and beating and sheeting, \\n Delaying and straying, and playing and spraying, \\n \\n Advancing and prancing, and glancing and dancing, \\n Recalling, turmoiling, and belling and toiling, \\n And thumping and bumping, and jumping and plumping, \\n And dashing and flashing, and splashing and clashing, \\n And so never ending, but always descending, \\n Sounds and motions for ever and ever are blending, \\n All at one and all o\\'er, with a mighty uproar - \\n And this way the water comes down at  Lodore . \\n \\n\\n\\n These lines, however, are only applicable to this fall after heavy rains, as during dry weather its vagaries are by no means so outrageous. From the top of the cascade there is a very fine view of  Derwentwater  and  Skiddaw . When flooded by rains, and swelled by the tributary waters of a thousand mountain rills,  Lodore  becomes truly magnificent. The tremendous roar of the rushing water, as it dashes from rock to rock, and leaps in white foam impetuously along its rugged course, is so loud, that it can be heard at a distance of nine or ten miles, in calm weather. Those who possess an adventurous spirit will find the rocky scenery in this neighbourhood worthy of being clambered over, even at the risk of a few sprains and bruises! At the inn here a canon is kept to gratify the curiosity of visitors who wish to hear the grand echoes of the locality reverberate from rock to rock. \\n\\n Little more than a mile beyond this is  Grange Bridge , which crosses  Borrowdale Beck ; but, before crossing it, pursue the road into  Borrowdale , a mile farther, in order to see the \\n\\n BOWDER STONE . \\n\\n This huge mass of rock lies a little to the left of the road, and, from the similarity of its veins to those of the adjoining cliffs, it has evidently fallen from them. In shape it bears some slight resemblance to a ship on its keel, and it is 62 feet long by 36 feet high, and 84 feet in circumference. It is estimated to weigh 1771 tons. A gentleman in the neigh-\\n\\n \\n\\nbourhood, who thought that he could improve upon nature, committed some depredations on the native simplicity of this rock and its locality; among other things he erected a ladder against the side of the rock, to enable aspiring strangers to reach the top of it. No good was gained by this, as the view is not nearly equal to that which may be obtained from any of the adjacent heights, while the rude wooden structure spoils the rugged outline of the stone. Just opposite to  Bowder Stone ,  Castle Crag  rears its head. Its name is derived from a Roman fortress which once crowned its summit, and guarded the pass of  Borrowdale . The views from this mount are grand and extensive. On one side are  Derwentwater ; its wooded islands, and the rich vale, speckled with human habitations, and mingled field and woodland scenery, with  Skiddaw  for a background. On the other side is the pass of  Borrowdale , where the mountains are congregated in massive confusion and wild grandeur. \\n\\n Returning to  Grange Bridge , cross over and follow the road which leads past a hamlet called  Manesty . Here there is as medicinal spring. Passing under  Cat Bells , which commands one of the best views of the valley and lake, the road enters the village of  Portinscale , beyond which  Keswick  is little more than a mile. Another pleasant excursion is round \\n\\n BASSENTHWAITE LAKE , \\n\\n Which lies between three and four miles to the north of  Derwentwater , with which it is connected by a small stream. It is four miles long, and a mile broad. Proceed by the road which leads to the village of  Braithwaite , on reaching which, turn to the right, and follow the road along the southern shore of the lake, which undulates pleasantly through varied and picturesque scenery, and skirts the base of the rugged hills called  Lord\\'s Seat  and  Barf . From this road are seen the three beautiful vales of  Braithwaite ,  Thornthwaite , and\\n\\n \\n\\n Keswick , as well as  Bassenthwaite Lake , along the margin of which it runs. At  Peel Wyke  there is a small tavern, and a little beyond it the road diverges to the right, where a guide-post directs to  Ouse Bridge . This bridge spans the  Derwent  at its source. From this point, and at  Armathwaite , a little farther on, the best views are to be had. A little beyond this is  Castle Inn , from which to  Keswick  is eight miles, by the northern shore of the lake.  Ouse Bridge , by the south shore, is nine and a half miles from the same town, and the whole excursion is about eighteen miles. While at  Castle Inn  a walk may be taken up to the top of the  Haws , from which is seen a magnificent view of the lake, and the vales of  Embleton  and  Isell . The way to this point is along the  Hesket road  for about a mile, and then turn to the right, and ascend the Haws. \\n\\n The secluded  Vale of St. John\\'s  is another interesting excursion of about thirteen miles. Follow the  Penrith  road for four miles towards the village of  Threlkeld , and just before reaching it, turn to the right into a road which follows the banks of the meandering  Greta . The valley is narrow, and extremely picturesque, having Great  Dodd  on the left, and  Naddle Fell  on the right. In the midst of this valley is the celebrated rock mentioned by  Sir Walter Scott  in his  Bridal of Triermain . It bears a striking resemblance to an old castle standing on the summit of a slight elevation. At the end of the  Vale of St John\\'s  the road joins the highway, about four and a half miles from  Keswick . \\n\\n In this walk a visit should be paid to the \\n\\n Druid\\'s Temple , \\n\\n The path to which diverges to the right, from the old road to  Penrith , a quarter of a mile from the toll-bar. There are forty-eight stones, chiefly granite, in this temple, which describe a circle of between eighty and a hundred feet in diameter. A little to one side is a small enclosure, formed by\\n\\n \\n\\nten stones. The circle is about two miles from Keswick, and stands on a hill, from which there is a very fine view of  Skiddaw ,  Helvellyn ,  Saddleback , and other mountains. This romantic vale is interesting, as having been the subject of poems by  Scott  and  Wordsworth . \\n\\n The valley of \\n\\n Watendlath \\n\\n Is a lonely secluded vale, which lies parallel with  Borrowdale . It forms a delightful ride or walk, but cannot easily be visited in a carriage. To reach it, proceed along the  Borrowdale road , past  Wallow Crag , towards  Barrow House , behind which the road runs towards a pretty tarn, out of which the stream which forms  Lodore waterfall  issues. A rustic bridge crosses the stream here. The walk may be prolonged, if desired, over the  Wythburn Fells  to  Thirlmere . The route is over rough heathy hills, which will delight the heart of a mountaineer. \\n\\n From  Keswick  to \\n\\n Sty Head \\n\\n Is twelve miles. Take the  Borrowdale  road, which has already been described as far as the  Bowder Stone . A little beyond  Rosthwaite  (six miles from  Keswick ) the valley divides into two, that on the left being  Stonethwaite , the one on the right  Seathwaite . Follow the latter for a mile or so, when you reach a farm-house called  Seatoller . A mile further are the Blacklead or \"Wad\" mines. Just under the mines are the celebrated Yews of  Borrowdale , one of which is seven yards in circumference. They are said to be the finest in  England . Like almost every other object in the Lake district, these yews have been made the subject of  Wordsworth\\'s  muse. At  Seatoller  a mountain track, diverging to the right, leads to  Buttermere . At  Seathwaite  the road ends,\\n\\n \\n\\nand a bridle path follows the stream to a little bridge, a mile farther up, which it crosses, and ascends  Sty Head .  Stockley Bride  is a curious specimen of native architecture, and the little cascade above it is very picturesque. Sty head is 1250 feet above the sea, and commands a splendid view of  Wastdale  and  the Pikes . On the first level in the ascent lies a tarn, which is fed by a streamlet from  Sprinkling Tarn , a few hundred feet higher up. In this excursion may be included the ascent of \\n\\n Scawfell , \\n\\n The highest mountain in  England . It s 3160 feet above the sea, and commands, of course, a most extensive view of all the mountains and valleys of the district for many miles around; including  Morecambe Bay  and the  Welsh Highlands  to the south, and the  Irish Sea  along the western horizon, while the prospect is bounded in the north by the blue mountains of  Scotland . In clear weather the  Isle of Man  can be seen. The best point for commencing the ascent is from  Strands , at the foot of  Wast Water .  \\n\\n There are many delightful short walks about  Keswick , which the tourist will easily discover, by a survey of the country from its various heights. Among them are  Castle Head , or, as the inhabitants call it,  Castlet , one mile from the town.  Friars Crag , a promontory stretching out into the lake, of which it commands a fine view, and also a distant one of  Lodore ; and a walk to the Druidical circle, already alluded to. The next excursion we shall describe is that to  \\n\\n BUTTERMERE . \\n\\n There are two roads to this lake, both of which are interesting; but only one admits of carriage travelling. We shall describe it first. Passing the village of  Portinscale , the road runs between  Foe Park Woods  and  Swinside  to the \\n\\n \\n\\n Three Road Ends . Take the one on the right, which, skirting  Swinside , leads through  Newlands  to  Buttermere . The scenery along this road is fine, particularly at a mountain called  Rawling End . Just after passing  Keskadale , the road ascends abruptly to  Newland\\'s Haws , after passing which it runs at a great height above the ravine, between it and the opposite hill. The view in this descent is magnificent, comprehending an immense range of mountains. The road passes a small chapel, near to which is the inn famous as being the residence of  Mary Robinson , the  Beauty of Buttermere . Mary\\'s history is briefly as follows:- She was the daughter of the innkeeper, whose house was not a little indebted for its custom to the attractions of Mary. Of course she had many wooers, but rejected them all in favour of a man named  Hatfield , who gave himself out to be  Colonel Hope . This man, who had fled from the arm of justice into these sequestered mountains, saw, loved, and married Mary in 1802; but not long afterwards was arrested for forgery, and carried to  Carlisle , where he was tried, found guilty, and hanged. Poor May remained an interesting young widow in her native valley for some time after this, and became famous in consequence of the reports of tourists regarding her beauty; but ultimately she became unromantic enough to marry a respectable farmer of  Calbeck . She dies a few years ago. \\n\\n The other road to this lake runs by  Lodore ,  Bowder Stone , and  Rosthwaite , where there is an inn. A little father, the valley divides; follow that on the right, called  Seathwaite , for a mile, to  Seatoller , where the road diverges to the right. It is rough and steep, and the pass is 1100 feet in height. From this point is a rapid descent into the vale at  Honister Crag , three miles from  Seatoller , which rises like a wall on the left to a height of 1500 feet. There are extensive slate quarries in this rock, the face of which is excavated into tiers of caverns for a considerable height.  Buttermere  is a small lake, about a mile and a half in length by a quarter of a mile in breadth. In form it is oblong, and sweeps round\\n\\n \\n\\na promontory at one end. The scenery around it is grand. Its eastern side is well wooded, while on the western side a long range of mountain slopes stretch from end to end, terminating everywhere precipitously in water. At the bottom of the valley,  Sour-milk-Gill  falls down the steep mountains, appearing like a thread of silver on their dark sides. The mountains that surround the lake -  High Crag ,  High Stile ,  Red Pike , &c. - almost overshadow its waters, and give to it a somewhat gloomy appearance, which is not a little heightened by the comparative want of cultivation and human habitations. The village of  Buttermere  stands on a slope near the foot of the lake. There is said to be good fishing here. \\n\\n Scale Force, \\n\\n One of the highest waterfalls in the country, is on the opposite side of the lake. A footpath, leading over the ground that divides the two lakes, conducts to it; but the tourist had better go by boat from the head of  Crummock Water , as the footpath is disagreeably dirty in wet weather. The fall is a mile from the landing-place. It is 160 feet high, and descends between two immense perpendicular walls of rock. From a point a little above the promontory, called  Ling Crag , is obtained the best view of \\n\\n CRUMMOCK WATER , \\n\\n And also the Lake of  Buttermere , and the surrounding country. On the east of this lake are the mountains called  Whiteside ,  Grassmoor , and  Whitelees , while  Melbreak  lies to the west. At  Scale Hill , three miles beyond  Ling Crag , there is an excellent inn. The lake is three miles long, and nearly a mile broad, and it has three small islands at its head. A boat excursion ought to be made upon it in order to see the surrounding mountains properly. The road to this lake from  Buttermere  is through pleasant groves and\\n\\n \\n\\nfields, and at its foot there is a pretty hill, partly wooded and partly cultivated, beyond which are the sloping fields of  Lowes Water . An old writer says, \"The two lakes bear a great resemblance to each other. Both are oblong; both wind round promontories, and both are surrounded by mountains. But the lower lake is nearly a mile longer than the upper; the lines it forms are much easier, and though it has less wood on its banks, the loss is compensated by a richer display of rock scenery.\" At the north-east corner of this lake the waters find an outlet in the river  Cocker , which flows through a pleasant country, a distance of about eight miles to  Cockermouth , the birth-place of the poet  Wordsworth . \\n\\n Scale Hill  is a good point from which to visit many interesting scenes, and might be found a convenient place to rest for a few days. There is a pleasant walk to an eminence in  Mr. Marshall\\'s  woods, and another in the direction of Lorton.  Ennerdale  may be visited by following the stream which flows from  Floutern Tarn . Besides the two routes above described, to  Buttermere  and  Crummock Water , there is another, which, though lengthened and circuitous, is in some respects better than either of them. This road leaves  Keswick  by the village of  Portinscale ;  Whinlatter , passing the celebrated yew tree; through the  vale of Lorton  to  Scale Hill  - a distance of twelve miles - and thence return to  Keswick  by  Buttermere  and  Newlands , or by the slate quarries at  Honister Crag , and reverse the  second  route described above. Two miles from  Crummock Water , in a secluded, thickly wooded valley, and surrounded by the wild mountains of  Low Fell ,  Blake Fell , and  Melbreck , lies the small lake called \\n\\n LOWES WATER . \\n\\n This lake is not more than a mile in length. As the finest scenery lies around its foot, it is necessary to go to the head\\n\\n \\n\\nof it and look back, in order to see it to advantage. The walk round it is about seven miles. \\n\\n While resident at  Keswick  the ascent of \\n\\n Skiddaw \\n\\n Should be made. Its height is 3022 feet above the sea, and is so easy of access that horses may be taken to the summit. From  Keswick  to the top is six miles; along the  Penrith  road, to a bridge beyond the toll-bar; cross the bridge, after which the road ascends steeply, skirting Latrig and traversing a plantation, after which another road is entered on the right; pursue this only for a few yards to a gate, just beyond which take the road to the left by the side of a fence to a hollow at the base of the steepest hill, on the right of which is a deep ravine; for a mile beyond this road ascends precipitously by the side of a stone wall which it crosses and proceeds straight forward, leaving the wall on the right, until it arrives at a barren moor called  Skiddaw Forest , where there is a spring of clear water, which will prove extremely refreshing to the thirsty climber. Beyond this the ascent, passing five elevations called  men , to the summit, is easy. The views from various points in ascending are remarkably fine - better, it is thought, than from the summit itself. The mountain is called \\n\\n Saddleback \\n\\n Is also worth ascending, but is usually omitted by tourists in consequence of its vicinity to  Skiddaw , although the views from it are thought to be finer.  Blencathra  was the ancient name of this mountain, on which is the  Threlkeld Tarn , alluded to by  Sir Walter , in his  Bridal of Triermain , in the following lines:- \\n\\n \\n \"Above her solitary tract \\n Rose  Glaramara\\'s  ridgy back, \\n \\n Amid whose yawning gulfs the sun \\n Cast umber\\'d radiance red and dun; \\n Though never sunbeam could discern \\n The surface of that sable tarn, \\n In whose black mirror you may spy \\n The stars while noontide lights the sky.\" \\n \\n\\n Wast Water  and  Ennerdale \\n\\n Are usually visited from  Whitehaven , but they can also be reached from  Keswick ; part of the way, however, has to be accomplished on foot. One route is by  Borrowdale , over  Styhead ; another is as follows:- Proceed past  Scale Hill , by any of the routes before mentioned, to  Lowes Water , and thence to  Lampleugh Cross  and  Ennerdale Bridge . Thence to  Calder Bridge , where there are two good inns, and on to  Gosforth  and  the Strands  in  Wastdale ; but this route is very circuitous.  Wast Water  is three miles in length, and three quarters of a mile in breadth, and the scenery around it is rugged and less attractive than that of most of the other lakes, from which circumstance, and the difficulty of access to it, it is seldom visited. There is nothing very striking in the features and character of  Ennerdale Lake , though it is not without its beauties; but, after the romantic and superb scenery which the tourist has already passed, we would recommend him to rest satisfied with the view of those lakes that is to be had from the various mountain tops he may have scaled during his progress through the  Lake District  -
